  Click-through URL

  ## Attributes

  - computedClickThroughUrl (String.t): Read-only convenience field representing the actual URL that will be used for this click-through. The URL is computed as follows:  - If defaultLandingPage is enabled then the campaign&#39;s default landing page URL is assigned to this field. - If defaultLandingPage is not enabled and a landingPageId is specified then that landing page&#39;s URL is assigned to this field. - If neither of the above cases apply, then the customClickThroughUrl is assigned to this field. Defaults to: `null`.
  - customClickThroughUrl (String.t): Custom click-through URL. Applicable if the defaultLandingPage field is set to false and the landingPageId field is left unset. Defaults to: `null`.
  - defaultLandingPage (boolean()): Whether the campaign default landing page is used. Defaults to: `null`.
  - landingPageId (String.t): ID of the landing page for the click-through URL. Applicable if the defaultLandingPage field is set to false. Defaults to: `null`.
