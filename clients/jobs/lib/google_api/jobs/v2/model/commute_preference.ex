  ## Attributes

  - allowNonStreetLevelAddress (boolean()): Optional. If &#x60;true&#x60;, jobs without street level addresses may also be returned. For city level addresses, the city center is used. For state and coarser level addresses, text matching is used. If this field is set to &#x60;false&#x60; or is not specified, only jobs that include street level addresses will be returned by commute search. Defaults to: `null`.
  - departureHourLocal (integer()): Optional.  The departure hour to use to calculate traffic impact. Accepts an integer between 0 and 23, representing the hour in the time zone of the start_location. Must not be present if road_traffic is specified. Defaults to: `null`.
  - method (String.t): Required.  The method of transportation for which to calculate the commute time. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [COMMUTE_METHOD_UNSPECIFIED, DRIVING, TRANSIT]
  - roadTraffic (String.t): Optional.  Specifies the traffic density to use when calculating commute time. Must not be present if departure_hour_local is specified. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [ROAD_TRAFFIC_UNSPECIFIED, TRAFFIC_FREE, BUSY_HOUR]
  - startLocation (LatLng): Required.  The latitude and longitude of the location from which to calculate the commute time. Defaults to: `null`.
  - travelTime (String.t): Required.  The maximum travel time in seconds. The maximum allowed value is &#x60;3600s&#x60; (one hour). Format is &#x60;123s&#x60;. Defaults to: `null`.
