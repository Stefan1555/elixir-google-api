  @moduledoc """
  A Job resource represents a job posting (also referred to as a \&quot;job listing\&quot; or \&quot;job requisition\&quot;). A job belongs to a Company, which is the hiring entity responsible for the job.

  ## Attributes

  - applicationEmailList ([String.t]): Optional but at least one of application_urls, application_email_list or application_instruction must be specified.  Use this field to specify email address(es) to which resumes or applications can be sent.  The maximum number of allowed characters is 255. Defaults to: `null`.
  - applicationInstruction (String.t): Optional but at least one of application_urls, application_email_list or application_instruction must be specified.  Use this field to provide instructions, such as \&quot;Mail your application to ...\&quot;, that a candidate can follow to apply for the job.  This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags.  The maximum number of allowed characters is 3,000. Defaults to: `null`.
  - applicationUrls ([String.t]): Optional but at least one of application_urls, application_email_list or application_instruction must be specified.  Use this URL field to direct an applicant to a website, for example to link to an online application form.  The maximum number of allowed characters is 2,000. Defaults to: `null`.
  - benefits ([String.t]): Optional.  The benefits included with the job. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of 
  - companyDisplayName (String.t): Output only.  The name of the company listing the job. Defaults to: `null`.
  - companyName (String.t): Optional but one of company_name or distributor_company_id must be provided.  The resource name of the company listing the job, such as /companies/foo. This field takes precedence over the distributor-assigned company identifier, distributor_company_id. Defaults to: `null`.
  - companyTitle (String.t): Deprecated. Use company_display_name instead.  Output only.  The name of the company listing the job. Defaults to: `null`.
  - compensationInfo (CompensationInfo): Optional.  Job compensation information. Defaults to: `null`.
  - createTime (DateTime.t): Output only.  The timestamp when this job was created. Defaults to: `null`.
  - customAttributes (%{optional(String.t) &#x3D;&gt; CustomAttribute}): Optional.  A map of fields to hold both filterable and non-filterable custom job attributes that are not covered by the provided structured fields.  This field is a more general combination of the deprecated id-based filterable_custom_fields and string-based non_filterable_custom_fields.  The keys of the map are strings up to 64 bytes and must match the pattern: a-zA-Z*.  At most 100 filterable and at most 100 unfilterable keys are supported. For filterable &#x60;string_values&#x60;, across all keys at most 200 values are allowed, with each string no more than 255 characters. For unfilterable &#x60;string_values&#x60;, the maximum total size of &#x60;string_values&#x60; across all keys is 50KB. Defaults to: `null`.
  - department (String.t): Optional.  The department or functional area within the company with the open position.  The maximum number of allowed characters is 255. Defaults to: `null`.
  - description (String.t): Required.  The description of the job, which typically includes a multi-paragraph description of the company and related information. Separate fields are provided on the job object for responsibilities, qualifications, and other job characteristics. Use of these separate job fields is recommended.  This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags.  The maximum number of allowed characters is 100,000. Defaults to: `null`.
  - distributorCompanyId (String.t): Optional but one of company_name or distributor_company_id must be provided.  A unique company identifier used by job distributors to identify an employer&#39;s company entity. company_name takes precedence over this field, and is the recommended field to use to identify companies.  The maximum number of allowed characters is 255. Defaults to: `null`.
  - educationLevels ([String.t]): Optional.  The desired education level for the job, such as \&quot;Bachelors\&quot;, \&quot;Masters\&quot;, \&quot;Doctorate\&quot;. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of 
  - employmentTypes ([String.t]): Optional.  The employment type(s) of a job, for example, full time or part time. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of 
  - endDate (DateTime): Optional.  The end date of the job in UTC time zone. Typically this field is used for contracting engagements. Dates prior to 1970/1/1 and invalid date formats are ignored. Defaults to: `null`.
  - expireTime (DateTime.t): Optional but strongly recommended for the best service experience.  The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can&#39;t be deleted or listed by the DeleteJob and ListJobs APIs, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same requisition_id, company_name and language_code.  The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs count over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are cleaned first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. The format of this field is RFC 3339 date strings. Example: 2000-01-01T00:00:00.999999999Z See [https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt).  A valid date range is between 1970-01-01T00:00:00.0Z and 2100-12-31T23:59:59.999Z. Invalid dates are ignored and treated as expire time not provided.  If this value is not provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#39;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC.  If this value is not provided but expiry_date is, expiry_date is used.  If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_job_fields. If the field masks include expiry_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#39;s last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn&#39;t updated. Defaults to: `null`.
  - expiryDate (DateTime): Deprecated. Use expire_time instead.  Optional but strongly recommended to be provided for the best service experience.  The expiration date of the job in UTC time. After 12 am on this date, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can&#39;t be deleted or listed by the DeleteJob and ListJobs APIs, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration date. It can also remain expired. Updating an expired job to be open fails if there is another existing open job with same requisition_id, company_name and language_code.  The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs count over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are removed first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out.  A valid date range is between 1970/1/1 and 2100/12/31. Invalid dates are ignored and treated as expiry date not provided.  If this value is not provided on job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#39;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC.  If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_job_fields. If the field masks include expiry_date, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job expires after 30 days from the job&#39;s last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn&#39;t updated. Defaults to: `null`.
  - extendedCompensationInfo (ExtendedCompensationInfo): Deprecated. Always use compensation_info.  Optional.  Job compensation information.  This field replaces compensation_info. Only CompensationInfo.entries or extended_compensation_info can be set, otherwise an exception is thrown. Defaults to: `null`.
  - filterableCustomFields (%{optional(String.t) &#x3D;&gt; CustomField}): Deprecated. Use custom_attributes instead.  Optional.  A map of fields to hold filterable custom job attributes not captured by the standard fields such as job_title, company_name, or level. These custom fields store arbitrary string values, and can be used for purposes not covered by the structured fields. For the best search experience, use of the structured rather than custom fields is recommended.  Data stored in these custom fields fields are indexed and searched against by keyword searches (see SearchJobsRequest.custom_field_filters][]).  The map key must be a number between 1-20. If an invalid key is provided on job create or update, an error is returned. Defaults to: `null`.
  - incentives (String.t): Optional.  A description of bonus, commission, and other compensation incentives associated with the job not including salary or pay.  The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000. Defaults to: `null`.
  - jobLocations ([JobLocation]): Output only.  Structured locations of the job, resolved from locations. Defaults to: `null`.
  - jobTitle (String.t): Required.  The title of the job, such as \&quot;Software Engineer\&quot;  The maximum number of allowed characters is 500. Defaults to: `null`.
  - languageCode (String.t): Optional.  The language of the posting. This field is distinct from any requirements for fluency that are associated with the job.  Language codes must be in BCP-47 format, such as \&quot;en-US\&quot; or \&quot;sr-Latn\&quot;. For more information, see [Tags for Identifying Languages](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47){: class&#x3D;\&quot;external\&quot; target&#x3D;\&quot;_blank\&quot; }.  If this field is unspecified and Job.description is present, detected language code based on Job.description is assigned, otherwise defaults to &#39;en_US&#39;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - level (String.t): Optional.  The experience level associated with the job, such as \&quot;Entry Level\&quot;. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [JOB_LEVEL_UNSPECIFIED, ENTRY_LEVEL, EXPERIENCED, MANAGER, DIRECTOR, EXECUTIVE]
  - locations ([String.t]): Optional but strongly recommended for the best service experience.  Location(s) where the emploeyer is looking to hire for this job posting.  Specifying the full street address(es) of the hiring location enables better API results, especially job searches by commute time.  At most 50 locations are allowed for best search performance. If a job has more locations, it is suggested to split it into multiple jobs with unique requisition_ids (e.g. &#39;ReqA&#39; becomes &#39;ReqA-1&#39;, &#39;ReqA-2&#39;, etc.) as multiple jobs with the same requisition_id, company_name and language_code are not allowed. If the original requisition_id must be preserved, a custom field should be used for storage. It is also suggested to group the locations that close to each other in the same job for better search experience.  The maximum number of allowed characters is 500. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): Required during job update.  Resource name assigned to a job by the API, for example, \&quot;/jobs/foo\&quot;. Use of this field in job queries and API calls is preferred over the use of requisition_id since this value is unique. Defaults to: `null`.
  - promotionValue (integer()): Optional.  A promotion value of the job, as determined by the client. The value determines the sort order of the jobs returned when searching for jobs using the featured jobs search call, with higher promotional values being returned first and ties being resolved by relevance sort. Only the jobs with a promotionValue &gt;0 are returned in a FEATURED_JOB_SEARCH.  Default value is 0, and negative values are treated as 0. Defaults to: `null`.
  - publishDate (DateTime): Optional.  The date this job was most recently published in UTC format. The default value is the time the request arrives at the server. Defaults to: `null`.
  - qualifications (String.t): Optional.  A description of the qualifications required to perform the job. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field.  This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags.  The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000. Defaults to: `null`.
  - referenceUrl (String.t): Output only.  The URL of a web page that displays job details. Defaults to: `null`.
  - region (String.t): Optional.  The job Region (for example, state, country) throughout which the job is available. If this field is set, a LocationFilter in a search query within the job region finds this job if an exact location match is not specified. If this field is set, setting job locations to the same location level as this field is strongly recommended. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [REGION_UNSPECIFIED, STATE_WIDE, NATION_WIDE, TELECOMMUTE]
  - requisitionId (String.t): Required.  The requisition ID, also referred to as the posting ID, assigned by the client to identify a job. This field is intended to be used by clients for client identification and tracking of listings. A job is not allowed to be created if there is another job with the same requisition_id, company_name and language_code.  The maximum number of allowed characters is 255. Defaults to: `null`.
  - responsibilities (String.t): Optional.  A description of job responsibilities. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field.  This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags.  The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000. Defaults to: `null`.
  - startDate (DateTime): Optional.  The start date of the job in UTC time zone. Typically this field is used for contracting engagements. Dates prior to 1970/1/1 and invalid date formats are ignored. Defaults to: `null`.
  - unindexedCustomFields (%{optional(String.t) &#x3D;&gt; CustomField}): Deprecated. Use custom_attributes instead.  Optional.  A map of fields to hold non-filterable custom job attributes, similar to filterable_custom_fields. These fields are distinct in that the data in these fields are not indexed. Therefore, the client cannot search against them, nor can the client use them to list jobs.  The key of the map can be any valid string. Defaults to: `null`.
  - updateTime (DateTime.t): Output only.  The timestamp when this job was last updated. Defaults to: `null`.
  - visibility (String.t): Optional.  The visibility of the job. Defaults to JobVisibility.PRIVATE if not specified. Currently only JobVisibility.PRIVATE is supported. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [JOB_VISIBILITY_UNSPECIFIED, PRIVATE, GOOGLE, PUBLIC]
