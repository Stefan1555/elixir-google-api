  @moduledoc """
  Input only.  The query required to perform a search query or histogram.

  ## Attributes

  - categories ([String.t]): Optional.  The category filter specifies the categories of jobs to search against. See Category for more information.  If a value is not specified, jobs from any category are searched against.  If multiple values are specified, jobs from any of the specified categories are searched against. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of 
  - commuteFilter (CommutePreference): Optional.   Allows filtering jobs by commute time with different travel methods (for  example, driving or public transit). Note: This only works with COMMUTE  MODE. When specified, [JobQuery.location_filters] is  ignored.   Currently we don&#39;t support sorting by commute time. Defaults to: `null`.
  - companyDisplayNames ([String.t]): Optional.  This filter specifies the exact company display name of the jobs to search against.  If a value isn&#39;t specified, jobs within the search results are associated with any company.  If multiple values are specified, jobs within the search results may be associated with any of the specified companies.  At most 20 company display name filters are allowed. Defaults to: `null`.
  - companyNames ([String.t]): Optional.  This filter specifies the company entities to search against.  If a value isn&#39;t specified, jobs are searched for against all companies.  If multiple values are specified, jobs are searched against the companies specified.  At most 20 company filters are allowed. Defaults to: `null`.
  - compensationFilter (CompensationFilter): Optional.  This search filter is applied only to Job.compensation_info. For example, if the filter is specified as \&quot;Hourly job with per-hour compensation &gt; $15\&quot;, only jobs meeting these criteria are searched. If a filter isn&#39;t defined, all open jobs are searched. Defaults to: `null`.
  - customAttributeFilter (String.t): Optional.  This filter specifies a structured syntax to match against the Job.custom_attributes marked as &#x60;filterable&#x60;.  The syntax for this expression is a subset of Google SQL syntax.  Supported operators are: &#x3D;, !&#x3D;, &lt;, &lt;&#x3D;, &gt;, &gt;&#x3D; where the left of the operator is a custom field key and the right of the operator is a number or string (surrounded by quotes) value.  Supported functions are LOWER(&lt;field_name&gt;) to perform case insensitive match and EMPTY(&lt;field_name&gt;) to filter on the existence of a key.  Boolean expressions (AND/OR/NOT) are supported up to 3 levels of nesting (for example, \&quot;((A AND B AND C) OR NOT D) AND E\&quot;), a maximum of 50 comparisons/functions are allowed in the expression. The expression must be &lt; 2000 characters in length.  Sample Query: (key1 &#x3D; \&quot;TEST\&quot; OR LOWER(key1)&#x3D;\&quot;test\&quot; OR NOT EMPTY(key1)) AND key2 &gt; 100 Defaults to: `null`.
  - disableSpellCheck (boolean()): Optional.  This flag controls the spell-check feature. If false, the service attempts to correct a misspelled query, for example, \&quot;enginee\&quot; is corrected to \&quot;engineer\&quot;.  Defaults to false: a spell check is performed. Defaults to: `null`.
  - employmentTypes ([String.t]): Optional.  The employment type filter specifies the employment type of jobs to search against, such as EmploymentType.FULL_TIME.  If a value is not specified, jobs in the search results include any employment type.  If multiple values are specified, jobs in the search results include any of the specified employment types. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of 
  - languageCodes ([String.t]): Optional.  This filter specifies the locale of jobs to search against, for example, \&quot;en-US\&quot;.  If a value isn&#39;t specified, the search results can contain jobs in any locale.   Language codes should be in BCP-47 format, such as \&quot;en-US\&quot; or \&quot;sr-Latn\&quot;. For more information, see [Tags for Identifying Languages](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47).  At most 10 language code filters are allowed. Defaults to: `null`.
  - locationFilters ([LocationFilter]): Optional.  The location filter specifies geo-regions containing the jobs to search against. See LocationFilter for more information.  If a location value isn&#39;t specified, jobs fitting the other search criteria are retrieved regardless of where they&#39;re located.  If multiple values are specified, jobs are retrieved from any of the specified locations. If different values are specified for the LocationFilter.distance_in_miles parameter, the maximum provided distance is used for all locations.  At most 5 location filters are allowed. Defaults to: `null`.
  - publishDateRange (String.t): Optional.  Jobs published within a range specified by this filter are searched against, for example, DateRange.PAST_MONTH. If a value isn&#39;t specified, all open jobs are searched against regardless of their published date. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [DATE_RANGE_UNSPECIFIED, PAST_24_HOURS, PAST_WEEK, PAST_MONTH, PAST_YEAR, PAST_3_DAYS]
  - query (String.t): Optional.  The query string that matches against the job title, description, and location fields.  The maximum query size is 255 bytes. Defaults to: `null`.
