defmodule GoogleApi.Jobs.V2.Model.SearchJobsRequest do
  @moduledoc """
  Input only.  The Request body of the &#x60;SearchJobs&#x60; call.

  ## Attributes

  - disableRelevanceThresholding (boolean()): Optional.  Controls whether to disable relevance thresholding. Relevance thresholding removes jobs that have low relevance in search results, for example, removing \&quot;Assistant to the CEO\&quot; positions from the search results of a search for \&quot;CEO\&quot;.  Disabling relevance thresholding improves the accuracy of subsequent search requests.  Defaults to false. Defaults to: `null`.
  - enableBroadening (boolean()): Optional.  Controls whether to broaden the search when it produces sparse results. Broadened queries append results to the end of the matching results list.  Defaults to false. Defaults to: `null`.
  - enablePreciseResultSize (boolean()): Optional.  Controls if the search job request requires the return of a precise count of the first 300 results. Setting this to &#x60;true&#x60; ensures consistency in the number of results per page. Best practice is to set this value to true if a client allows users to jump directly to a non-sequential search results page.  Enabling this flag may adversely impact performance.  Defaults to false. Defaults to: `null`.
  - filters (JobFilters): Deprecated. Use query instead.  Optional.  Restrictions on the scope of the search request, such as filtering by location. Defaults to: `null`.
  - histogramFacets (HistogramFacets): Optional.  Restrictions on what fields to perform histogram on, such as &#x60;COMPANY_SIZE&#x60; etc. Defaults to: `null`.
  - jobView (String.t): Optional.  The number of job attributes returned for jobs in the search response. Defaults to JobView.SMALL if no value is specified. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [JOB_VIEW_UNSPECIFIED, SMALL, MINIMAL, FULL]
  - mode (String.t): Required.  Mode of a search. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [SEARCH_MODE_UNSPECIFIED, JOB_SEARCH, FEATURED_JOB_SEARCH, EMAIL_ALERT_SEARCH]
  - offset (integer()): Optional.  An integer that specifies the current offset (that is, starting result location, amongst the jobs deemed by the API as relevant) in search results. This field is only considered if page_token is unset.  For example, 0 means to  return results starting from the first matching job, and 10 means to return from the 11th job. This can be used for pagination, (for example, pageSize &#x3D; 10 and offset &#x3D; 10 means to return from the second page). Defaults to: `null`.
  - orderBy (String.t): Deprecated. Use sort_by instead.  Optional.  The criteria determining how search results are sorted. Defaults to SortBy.RELEVANCE_DESC if no value is specified. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [SORT_BY_UNSPECIFIED, RELEVANCE_DESC, PUBLISHED_DATE_DESC, UPDATED_DATE_DESC, TITLE, TITLE_DESC, ANNUALIZED_BASE_COMPENSATION, ANNUALIZED_TOTAL_COMPENSATION, ANNUALIZED_BASE_COMPENSATION_DESC, ANNUALIZED_TOTAL_COMPENSATION_DESC]
  - pageSize (integer()): Optional.  A limit on the number of jobs returned in the search results. Increasing this value above the default value of 10 can increase search response time. The value can be between 1 and 100. Defaults to: `null`.
  - pageToken (String.t): Optional.  The token specifying the current offset within search results. See SearchJobsResponse.next_page_token for an explanation of how to obtain the next set of query results. Defaults to: `null`.
  - query (JobQuery): Optional.  Query used to search against jobs, such as keyword, location filters, etc. Defaults to: `null`.
  - requestMetadata (RequestMetadata): Required.  The meta information collected about the job searcher, used to improve the search quality of the service. The identifiers, (such as &#x60;user_id&#x60;) are provided by users, and must be unique and consistent. Defaults to: `null`.
  - sortBy (String.t): Optional.  The criteria determining how search results are sorted. Defaults to SortBy.RELEVANCE_DESC if no value is specified. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [SORT_BY_UNSPECIFIED, RELEVANCE_DESC, PUBLISHED_DATE_DESC, UPDATED_DATE_DESC, TITLE, TITLE_DESC, ANNUALIZED_BASE_COMPENSATION, ANNUALIZED_TOTAL_COMPENSATION, ANNUALIZED_BASE_COMPENSATION_DESC, ANNUALIZED_TOTAL_COMPENSATION_DESC]
