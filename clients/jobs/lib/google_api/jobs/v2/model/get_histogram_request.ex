defmodule GoogleApi.Jobs.V2.Model.GetHistogramRequest do
  @moduledoc """
  Deprecated. Use SearchJobsRequest.histogram_facets instead to make a single call with both search and histogram.  Input only.  A request for the &#x60;GetHistogram&#x60; method.

  ## Attributes

  - allowBroadening (boolean()): Optional.  Controls whether to broaden the search to avoid too few results for a given query in instances where a search has sparse results. Results from a broadened query is a superset of the results from the original query.  Defaults to false. Defaults to: `null`.
  - filters (JobFilters): Deprecated. Use query instead.  Optional.  Restrictions on the scope of the histogram. Defaults to: `null`.
  - query (JobQuery): Optional.  Query used to search against jobs, such as keyword, location filters, etc. Defaults to: `null`.
  - requestMetadata (RequestMetadata): Meta information, such as &#x60;user_id&#x60;, collected from the job searcher or other entity conducting a job search, is used to improve the service&#39;s search quality. Users determine identifier values, which must be unique and consist. Defaults to: `null`.
  - searchTypes ([String.t]): Required.  A list of facets that specify the histogram data to be calculated against and returned.  Histogram response times can be slow, and counts can be approximations. This call may be temporarily or permanently removed prior to the production release of Cloud Talent Solution. Defaults to: `null`.
