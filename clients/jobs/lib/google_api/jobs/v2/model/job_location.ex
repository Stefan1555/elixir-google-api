defmodule GoogleApi.Jobs.V2.Model.JobLocation do
  @moduledoc """
  Output only.  A resource that represents a location with full geographic information.

  ## Attributes

  - latLng (LatLng): An object representing a latitude/longitude pair. Defaults to: `null`.
  - locationType (String.t): The type of a location, which corresponds to the address lines field of PostalAddress. For example, \&quot;Downtown, Atlanta, GA, USA\&quot; has a type of LocationType#NEIGHBORHOOD, and \&quot;Kansas City, KS, USA\&quot; has a type of LocationType#LOCALITY. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [LOCATION_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED, COUNTRY, ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA, SUB_ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA, LOCALITY, POSTAL_CODE, SUB_LOCALITY, SUB_LOCALITY_1, SUB_LOCALITY_2, NEIGHBORHOOD, STREET_ADDRESS]
  - postalAddress (PostalAddress): Postal address of the location that includes human readable information, such as postal delivery and payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premises, P.O. Box, or other delivery location. Defaults to: `null`.
  - radiusMeters (float()): Radius in meters of the job location. This value is derived from the location bounding box in which a circle with the specified radius centered from LatLng coves the area associated with the job location. For example, currently, \&quot;Mountain View, CA, USA\&quot; has a radius of 7885.79 meters. Defaults to: `null`.
