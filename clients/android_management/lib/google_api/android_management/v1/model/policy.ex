  A policy resources represents a group settings that govern the behavior of a managed device and the apps installed on it.

  ## Attributes

  - factoryResetDisabled (boolean()): Whether factory resetting from settings is disabled. Defaults to: `null`.
  - frpAdminEmails ([String.t]): Email addresses of device administrators for factory reset protection.

If no admins are specified, the device won&#39;t provide factory reset protection. Defaults to: `null`.
  - funDisabled (boolean()): Whether the user is allowed to have fun. Controls whether the Easter egg game in Settings is disabled. Defaults to: `null`.

  - keyguardDisabled (boolean()): Whether the keyguard is disabled. Defaults to: `null`.
  - keyguardDisabledFeatures ([String.t]): Disabled keyguard customizations, such as widgets. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of 
  - kioskCustomLauncherEnabled (boolean()): Whether the kiosk custom launcher is enabled. This replaces the home screen with a launcher that locks down the device to the apps installed via the applications setting. The apps appear on a single page in alphabetical order. It is recommended to also use status_bar_disabled to block access to device settings. Defaults to: `null`.
  - locationMode (String.t): The degree of location detection enabled. The user may change the value unless the user is otherwise blocked from accessing device settings. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [LOCATION_MODE_UNSPECIFIED, HIGH_ACCURACY, SENSORS_ONLY, BATTERY_SAVING, OFF]
  - longSupportMessage (UserFacingMessage): A message displayed to the user in the device administators settings screen. Defaults to: `null`.
  - maximumTimeToLock (String.t): Maximum time in milliseconds for user activity until the device locks. A value of 0 means there is no restriction. Defaults to: `null`.
  - mobileNetworksConfigDisabled (boolean()): Whether configuring mobile networks is disabled. Defaults to: `null`.
  - modifyAccountsDisabled (boolean()): Whether adding or removing accounts is disabled. Defaults to: `null`.
  - mountPhysicalMediaDisabled (boolean()): Whether the user mounting physical external media is disabled. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): The name of the policy in the form enterprises/{enterpriseId}/policies/{policyId}. Defaults to: `null`.
  - networkEscapeHatchEnabled (boolean()): Whether the network escape hatch is enabled. If a network connection can&#39;t be made at boot time, the escape hatch prompts the user to temporarily connect to a network in order to refresh the device policy. After applying policy, the temporary network will be forgotten and the device will continue booting. This prevents being unable to connect to a network if there is no suitable network in the last policy and the device boots into an app in lock task mode, or the user is otherwise unable to reach device settings. Defaults to: `null`.
  - networkResetDisabled (boolean()): Whether resetting network settings is disabled. Defaults to: `null`.
  - openNetworkConfiguration (%{optional(String.t) &#x3D;&gt; String.t}): Network configuration for the device. See configure networks for more information. Defaults to: `null`.

  - passwordRequirements (PasswordRequirements): Password requirements. DEPRECATED - Use password_policies Defaults to: `null`.
  - permissionGrants ([PermissionGrant]): Explicit permission or group grants or denials for all apps. These values override the default_permission_policy. Defaults to: `null`.
  - permittedInputMethods (PackageNameList): If present, only the input methods provided by packages in this list are permitted. If this field is present, but the list is empty, then only system input methods are permitted. Defaults to: `null`.
  - persistentPreferredActivities ([PersistentPreferredActivity]): Default intent handler activities. Defaults to: `null`.
  - playStoreMode (String.t): This mode controls which apps are available to the user in the Play Store and the behavior on the device when apps are removed from the policy. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [PLAY_STORE_MODE_UNSPECIFIED, WHITELIST, BLACKLIST]
  - privateKeySelectionEnabled (boolean()): Allows showing UI on a device for a user to choose a private key alias if there are no matching rules in ChoosePrivateKeyRules. For devices below Android P, setting this may leave enterprise keys vulnerable. Defaults to: `null`.
  - recommendedGlobalProxy (ProxyInfo): The network-independent global HTTP proxy. Typically proxies should be configured per-network in open_network_configuration. However for unusual configurations like general internal filtering a global HTTP proxy may be useful. If the proxy is not accessible, network access may break. The global proxy is only a recommendation and some apps may ignore it. Defaults to: `null`.
  - removeUserDisabled (boolean()): Whether removing other users is disabled. Defaults to: `null`.
  - safeBootDisabled (boolean()): Whether rebooting the device into safe boot is disabled. Defaults to: `null`.

  - smsDisabled (boolean()): Whether sending and receiving SMS messages is disabled. Defaults to: `null`.
  - statusBarDisabled (boolean()): Whether the status bar is disabled. This disables notifications, quick settings, and other screen overlays that allow escape from full-screen mode. Defaults to: `null`.
  - statusReportingSettings (StatusReportingSettings): Status reporting settings Defaults to: `null`.
  - stayOnPluggedModes ([String.t]): The battery plugged in modes for which the device stays on. When using this setting, it is recommended to clear maximum_time_to_lock so that the device doesn&#39;t lock itself while it stays on. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of 
  - systemUpdate (SystemUpdate): The system update policy, which controls how OS updates are applied. If the update type is WINDOWED, the update window will automatically apply to Play app updates as well. Defaults to: `null`.
  - tetheringConfigDisabled (boolean()): Whether configuring tethering and portable hotspots is disabled. Defaults to: `null`.
  - uninstallAppsDisabled (boolean()): Whether user uninstallation of applications is disabled. Defaults to: `null`.
  - unmuteMicrophoneDisabled (boolean()): Whether the microphone is muted and adjusting microphone volume is disabled. Defaults to: `null`.
  - usbFileTransferDisabled (boolean()): Whether transferring files over USB is disabled. Defaults to: `null`.
