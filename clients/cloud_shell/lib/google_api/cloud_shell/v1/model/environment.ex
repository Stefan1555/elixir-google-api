defmodule GoogleApi.CloudShell.V1.Model.Environment do
  @moduledoc """
  A Cloud Shell environment, which is defined as the combination of a Docker image specifying what is installed on the environment and a home directory containing the user&#39;s data that will remain across sessions. Each user has a single environment with the ID \&quot;default\&quot;.

  ## Attributes

  - dockerImage (String.t): Required. Full path to the Docker image used to run this environment, e.g. \&quot;gcr.io/dev-con/cloud-devshell:latest\&quot;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - id (String.t): Output only. The environment&#39;s identifier, which is always \&quot;default\&quot;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): Output only. Full name of this resource, in the format &#x60;users/{owner_email}/environments/{environment_id}&#x60;. &#x60;{owner_email}&#x60; is the email address of the user to whom this environment belongs, and &#x60;{environment_id}&#x60; is the identifier of this environment. For example, &#x60;users/someone@example.com/environments/default&#x60;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - publicKeys ([PublicKey]): Output only. Public keys associated with the environment. Clients can connect to this environment via SSH only if they possess a private key corresponding to at least one of these public keys. Keys can be added to or removed from the environment using the CreatePublicKey and DeletePublicKey methods. Defaults to: `null`.
  - sshHost (String.t): Output only. Host to which clients can connect to initiate SSH sessions with the environment. Defaults to: `null`.
  - sshPort (integer()): Output only. Port to which clients can connect to initiate SSH sessions with the environment. Defaults to: `null`.
  - sshUsername (String.t): Output only. Username that clients should use when initiating SSH sessions with the environment. Defaults to: `null`.
