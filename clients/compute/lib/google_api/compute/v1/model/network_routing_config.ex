  A routing configuration attached to a network resource. The message includes the list of routers associated with the network, and a flag indicating the type of routing behavior to enforce network-wide.

  ## Attributes

  - routingMode (String.t): The network-wide routing mode to use. If set to REGIONAL, this network&#39;s cloud routers will only advertise routes with subnets of this network in the same region as the router. If set to GLOBAL, this network&#39;s cloud routers will advertise routes with all subnets of this network, across regions. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [GLOBAL, REGIONAL]
