defmodule GoogleApi.Compute.V1.Model.TargetHttpsProxy do
  @moduledoc """
  A TargetHttpsProxy resource. This resource defines an HTTPS proxy. (&#x3D;&#x3D; resource_for beta.targetHttpsProxies &#x3D;&#x3D;) (&#x3D;&#x3D; resource_for v1.targetHttpsProxies &#x3D;&#x3D;)

  ## Attributes

  - creationTimestamp (String.t): [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format. Defaults to: `null`.
  - description (String.t): An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource. Defaults to: `null`.
  - id (String.t): [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server. Defaults to: `null`.
  - kind (String.t): [Output Only] Type of resource. Always compute#targetHttpsProxy for target HTTPS proxies. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression &#x60;[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?&#x60; which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash. Defaults to: `null`.
  - quicOverride (String.t): Specifies the QUIC override policy for this TargetHttpsProxy resource. This determines whether the load balancer will attempt to negotiate QUIC with clients or not. Can specify one of NONE, ENABLE, or DISABLE. Specify ENABLE to always enable QUIC, Enables QUIC when set to ENABLE, and disables QUIC when set to DISABLE. If NONE is specified, uses the QUIC policy with no user overrides, which is equivalent to DISABLE. Not specifying this field is equivalent to specifying NONE. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [DISABLE, ENABLE, NONE]
  - selfLink (String.t): [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource. Defaults to: `null`.
  - sslCertificates ([String.t]): URLs to SslCertificate resources that are used to authenticate connections between users and the load balancer. At least one SSL certificate must be specified. Currently, you may specify up to 15 SSL certificates. Defaults to: `null`.
  - sslPolicy (String.t): URL of SslPolicy resource that will be associated with the TargetHttpsProxy resource. If not set, the TargetHttpsProxy resource will not have any SSL policy configured. Defaults to: `null`.
  - urlMap (String.t): A fully-qualified or valid partial URL to the UrlMap resource that defines the mapping from URL to the BackendService. For example, the following are all valid URLs for specifying a URL map:   - https://www.googleapis.compute/v1/projects/project/global/urlMaps/url-map  - projects/project/global/urlMaps/url-map  - global/urlMaps/url-map Defaults to: `null`.
