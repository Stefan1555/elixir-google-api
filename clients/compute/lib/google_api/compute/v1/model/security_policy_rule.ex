  - description (String.t): An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource. Defaults to: `null`.
  - kind (String.t): [Output only] Type of the resource. Always compute#securityPolicyRule for security policy rules Defaults to: `null`.
  - match (SecurityPolicyRuleMatcher): A match condition that incoming traffic is evaluated against. If it evaluates to true, the corresponding ?action? is enforced. Defaults to: `null`.
  - preview (boolean()): If set to true, the specified action is not enforced. Defaults to: `null`.
  - priority (integer()): An integer indicating the priority of a rule in the list. The priority must be a positive value between 0 and 2147483647. Rules are evaluated from highest to lowest priority where 0 is the highest priority and 2147483647 is the lowest prority. Defaults to: `null`.
