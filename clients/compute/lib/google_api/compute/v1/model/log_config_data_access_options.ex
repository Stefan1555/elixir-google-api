defmodule GoogleApi.Compute.V1.Model.LogConfigDataAccessOptions do
  @moduledoc """
  Write a Data Access (Gin) log

  ## Attributes

  - logMode (String.t): Whether Gin logging should happen in a fail-closed manner at the caller. This is relevant only in the LocalIAM implementation, for now.  NOTE: Logging to Gin in a fail-closed manner is currently unsupported while work is being done to satisfy the requirements of go/345. Currently, setting LOG_FAIL_CLOSED mode will have no effect, but still exists because there is active work being done to support it (b/115874152). Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [LOG_FAIL_CLOSED, LOG_MODE_UNSPECIFIED]
