defmodule GoogleApi.Compute.V1.Model.TargetSslProxy do
  @moduledoc """
  A TargetSslProxy resource. This resource defines an SSL proxy. (&#x3D;&#x3D; resource_for beta.targetSslProxies &#x3D;&#x3D;) (&#x3D;&#x3D; resource_for v1.targetSslProxies &#x3D;&#x3D;)

  ## Attributes

  - creationTimestamp (String.t): [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format. Defaults to: `null`.
  - description (String.t): An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource. Defaults to: `null`.
  - id (String.t): [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server. Defaults to: `null`.
  - kind (String.t): [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#targetSslProxy for target SSL proxies. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression &#x60;[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?&#x60; which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.

    - Enum - one of [NONE, PROXY_V1]
  - selfLink (String.t): [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource. Defaults to: `null`.
  - service (String.t): URL to the BackendService resource. Defaults to: `null`.
  - sslCertificates ([String.t]): URLs to SslCertificate resources that are used to authenticate connections to Backends. At least one SSL certificate must be specified. Currently, you may specify up to 15 SSL certificates. Defaults to: `null`.
  - sslPolicy (String.t): URL of SslPolicy resource that will be associated with the TargetSslProxy resource. If not set, the TargetSslProxy resource will not have any SSL policy configured. Defaults to: `null`.
