defmodule GoogleApi.Compute.V1.Model.UrlMap do
  @moduledoc """
  A UrlMap resource. This resource defines the mapping from URL to the BackendService resource, based on the \&quot;longest-match\&quot; of the URL&#39;s host and path.

  ## Attributes

  - creationTimestamp (String.t): [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format. Defaults to: `null`.
  - defaultService (String.t): The URL of the backendService resource if none of the hostRules match. Use defaultService instead of defaultRouteAction when simple routing to a backendService is desired and other advanced capabilities like traffic splitting and rewrites are not required. Only one of defaultService, defaultRouteAction or defaultUrlRedirect should must be set. Defaults to: `null`.
  - description (String.t): An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource. Defaults to: `null`.
  - fingerprint (binary()): Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored in this object. This field is used in optimistic locking. This field will be ignored when inserting a UrlMap. An up-to-date fingerprint must be provided in order to update the UrlMap, otherwise the request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet.  To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve a UrlMap. Defaults to: `null`.
  - hostRules ([HostRule]): The list of HostRules to use against the URL. Defaults to: `null`.
  - id (String.t): [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server. Defaults to: `null`.
  - kind (String.t): [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#urlMaps for url maps. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression &#x60;[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?&#x60; which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash. Defaults to: `null`.
  - pathMatchers ([PathMatcher]): The list of named PathMatchers to use against the URL. Defaults to: `null`.
  - selfLink (String.t): [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource. Defaults to: `null`.
  - tests ([UrlMapTest]): The list of expected URL mapping tests. Request to update this UrlMap will succeed only if all of the test cases pass. You can specify a maximum of 100 tests per UrlMap. Defaults to: `null`.
