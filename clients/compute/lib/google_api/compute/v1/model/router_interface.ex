  ## Attributes

  - ipRange (String.t): IP address and range of the interface. The IP range must be in the RFC3927 link-local IP space. The value must be a CIDR-formatted string, for example: 169.254.0.1/30. NOTE: Do not truncate the address as it represents the IP address of the interface. Defaults to: `null`.
  - linkedInterconnectAttachment (String.t): URI of the linked interconnect attachment. It must be in the same region as the router. Each interface can have at most one linked resource and it could either be a VPN Tunnel or an interconnect attachment. Defaults to: `null`.
  - linkedVpnTunnel (String.t): URI of the linked VPN tunnel. It must be in the same region as the router. Each interface can have at most one linked resource and it could either be a VPN Tunnel or an interconnect attachment. Defaults to: `null`.
  - managementType (String.t): [Output Only] The resource that configures and manages this interface. MANAGED_BY_USER is the default value and can be managed by you or other users; MANAGED_BY_ATTACHMENT is an interface that is configured and managed by Cloud Interconnect, specifically by an InterconnectAttachment of type PARTNER. Google will automatically create, update, and delete this type of interface when the PARTNER InterconnectAttachment is created, updated, or deleted. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [MANAGED_BY_ATTACHMENT, MANAGED_BY_USER]
  - name (String.t): Name of this interface entry. The name must be 1-63 characters long and comply with RFC1035. Defaults to: `null`.
