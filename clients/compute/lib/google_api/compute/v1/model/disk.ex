  A Disk resource. (&#x3D;&#x3D; resource_for beta.disks &#x3D;&#x3D;) (&#x3D;&#x3D; resource_for v1.disks &#x3D;&#x3D;)

  ## Attributes

  - creationTimestamp (String.t): [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format. Defaults to: `null`.
  - description (String.t): An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource. Defaults to: `null`.
  - diskEncryptionKey (CustomerEncryptionKey): Encrypts the disk using a customer-supplied encryption key.  After you encrypt a disk with a customer-supplied key, you must provide the same key if you use the disk later (e.g. to create a disk snapshot or an image, or to attach the disk to a virtual machine).  Customer-supplied encryption keys do not protect access to metadata of the disk.  If you do not provide an encryption key when creating the disk, then the disk will be encrypted using an automatically generated key and you do not need to provide a key to use the disk later. Defaults to: `null`.
  - guestOsFeatures ([GuestOsFeature]): A list of features to enable on the guest operating system. Applicable only for bootable images. Read  Enabling guest operating system features to see a list of available options. Defaults to: `null`.
  - id (String.t): [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server. Defaults to: `null`.
  - kind (String.t): [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#disk for disks. Defaults to: `null`.
  - labelFingerprint (binary()): A fingerprint for the labels being applied to this disk, which is essentially a hash of the labels set used for optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change labels, otherwise the request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet.  To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve a disk. Defaults to: `null`.
  - labels (%{optional(String.t) &#x3D;&gt; String.t}): Labels to apply to this disk. These can be later modified by the setLabels method. Defaults to: `null`.
  - lastAttachTimestamp (String.t): [Output Only] Last attach timestamp in RFC3339 text format. Defaults to: `null`.
  - lastDetachTimestamp (String.t): [Output Only] Last detach timestamp in RFC3339 text format. Defaults to: `null`.
  - licenseCodes ([String.t]): Integer license codes indicating which licenses are attached to this disk. Defaults to: `null`.
  - licenses ([String.t]): A list of publicly visible licenses. Reserved for Google&#39;s use. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression &#x60;[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?&#x60; which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash. Defaults to: `null`.
  - options (String.t): Internal use only. Defaults to: `null`.
  - physicalBlockSizeBytes (String.t): Physical block size of the persistent disk, in bytes. If not present in a request, a default value is used. Currently supported sizes are 4096 and 16384, other sizes may be added in the future. If an unsupported value is requested, the error message will list the supported values for the caller&#39;s project. Defaults to: `null`.
  - region (String.t): [Output Only] URL of the region where the disk resides. Only applicable for regional resources. You must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is not settable as a field in the request body. Defaults to: `null`.
  - replicaZones ([String.t]): URLs of the zones where the disk should be replicated to. Only applicable for regional resources. Defaults to: `null`.
  - selfLink (String.t): [Output Only] Server-defined fully-qualified URL for this resource. Defaults to: `null`.
  - sizeGb (String.t): Size of the persistent disk, specified in GB. You can specify this field when creating a persistent disk using the sourceImage or sourceSnapshot parameter, or specify it alone to create an empty persistent disk.  If you specify this field along with sourceImage or sourceSnapshot, the value of sizeGb must not be less than the size of the sourceImage or the size of the snapshot. Acceptable values are 1 to 65536, inclusive. Defaults to: `null`.
  - sourceImage (String.t): The source image used to create this disk. If the source image is deleted, this field will not be set.  To create a disk with one of the public operating system images, specify the image by its family name. For example, specify family/debian-9 to use the latest Debian 9 image: projects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-9   Alternatively, use a specific version of a public operating system image: projects/debian-cloud/global/images/debian-9-stretch-vYYYYMMDD   To create a disk with a custom image that you created, specify the image name in the following format: global/images/my-custom-image   You can also specify a custom image by its image family, which returns the latest version of the image in that family. Replace the image name with family/family-name: global/images/family/my-image-family Defaults to: `null`.
  - sourceImageEncryptionKey (CustomerEncryptionKey): The customer-supplied encryption key of the source image. Required if the source image is protected by a customer-supplied encryption key. Defaults to: `null`.
  - sourceImageId (String.t): [Output Only] The ID value of the image used to create this disk. This value identifies the exact image that was used to create this persistent disk. For example, if you created the persistent disk from an image that was later deleted and recreated under the same name, the source image ID would identify the exact version of the image that was used. Defaults to: `null`.
  - sourceSnapshot (String.t): The source snapshot used to create this disk. You can provide this as a partial or full URL to the resource. For example, the following are valid values:   - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/global/snapshots/snapshot  - projects/project/global/snapshots/snapshot  - global/snapshots/snapshot Defaults to: `null`.
  - sourceSnapshotEncryptionKey (CustomerEncryptionKey): The customer-supplied encryption key of the source snapshot. Required if the source snapshot is protected by a customer-supplied encryption key. Defaults to: `null`.
  - sourceSnapshotId (String.t): [Output Only] The unique ID of the snapshot used to create this disk. This value identifies the exact snapshot that was used to create this persistent disk. For example, if you created the persistent disk from a snapshot that was later deleted and recreated under the same name, the source snapshot ID would identify the exact version of the snapshot that was used. Defaults to: `null`.
  - status (String.t): [Output Only] The status of disk creation. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [CREATING, FAILED, READY, RESTORING]
  - type (String.t): URL of the disk type resource describing which disk type to use to create the disk. Provide this when creating the disk. For example: project/zones/zone/diskTypes/pd-standard or pd-ssd Defaults to: `null`.
  - users ([String.t]): [Output Only] Links to the users of the disk (attached instances) in form: project/zones/zone/instances/instance Defaults to: `null`.
  - zone (String.t): [Output Only] URL of the zone where the disk resides. You must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is not settable as a field in the request body. Defaults to: `null`.
