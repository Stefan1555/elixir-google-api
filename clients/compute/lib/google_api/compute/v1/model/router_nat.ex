defmodule GoogleApi.Compute.V1.Model.RouterNat do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents a Nat resource. It enables the VMs within the specified subnetworks to access Internet without external IP addresses. It specifies a list of subnetworks (and the ranges within) that want to use NAT. Customers can also provide the external IPs that would be used for NAT. GCP would auto-allocate ephemeral IPs if no external IPs are provided.

  ## Attributes

  - icmpIdleTimeoutSec (integer()): Timeout (in seconds) for ICMP connections. Defaults to 30s if not set. Defaults to: `null`.
  - minPortsPerVm (integer()): Minimum number of ports allocated to a VM from this NAT config. If not set, a default number of ports is allocated to a VM. This gets rounded up to the nearest power of 2. Eg. if the value of this field is 50, at least 64 ports will be allocated to a VM. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): Unique name of this Nat service. The name must be 1-63 characters long and comply with RFC1035. Defaults to: `null`.
  - natIpAllocateOption (String.t): Specify the NatIpAllocateOption. If it is AUTO_ONLY, then nat_ip should be empty. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [AUTO_ONLY, MANUAL_ONLY]
  - natIps ([String.t]): A list of URLs of the IP resources used for this Nat service. These IPs must be valid static external IP addresses assigned to the project. max_length is subject to change post alpha. Defaults to: `null`.
  - sourceSubnetworkIpRangesToNat (String.t): Specify the Nat option. If this field contains ALL_SUBNETWORKS_ALL_IP_RANGES or ALL_SUBNETWORKS_ALL_PRIMARY_IP_RANGES, then there should not be any other Router.Nat section in any Router for this network in this region. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [ALL_SUBNETWORKS_ALL_IP_RANGES, ALL_SUBNETWORKS_ALL_PRIMARY_IP_RANGES, LIST_OF_SUBNETWORKS]
  - subnetworks ([RouterNatSubnetworkToNat]): A list of Subnetwork resources whose traffic should be translated by NAT Gateway. It is used only when LIST_OF_SUBNETWORKS is selected for the SubnetworkIpRangeToNatOption above. Defaults to: `null`.
  - tcpEstablishedIdleTimeoutSec (integer()): Timeout (in seconds) for TCP established connections. Defaults to 1200s if not set. Defaults to: `null`.
  - tcpTransitoryIdleTimeoutSec (integer()): Timeout (in seconds) for TCP transitory connections. Defaults to 30s if not set. Defaults to: `null`.
  - udpIdleTimeoutSec (integer()): Timeout (in seconds) for UDP connections. Defaults to 30s if not set. Defaults to: `null`.
