defmodule GoogleApi.CloudResourceManager.V1.Model.ResourceId do
  @moduledoc """
  A container to reference an id for any resource type. A &#x60;resource&#x60; in Google Cloud Platform is a generic term for something you (a developer) may want to interact with through one of our API&#39;s. Some examples are an App Engine app, a Compute Engine instance, a Cloud SQL database, and so on.

  ## Attributes

  - id (String.t): Required field for the type-specific id. This should correspond to the id used in the type-specific API&#39;s. Defaults to: `null`.
  - type (String.t): Required field representing the resource type this id is for. At present, the valid types are: \&quot;organization\&quot; and \&quot;folder\&quot;. Defaults to: `null`.
