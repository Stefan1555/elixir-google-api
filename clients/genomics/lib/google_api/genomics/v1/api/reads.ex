defmodule GoogleApi.Genomics.V1.Api.Reads do

  API calls for all endpoints tagged `Reads`.

  alias GoogleApi.Genomics.V1.Connection
  alias GoogleApi.Gax.{Request, Response}

  @doc """
  Gets a list of reads for one or more read group sets.  Reads search operates over a genomic coordinate space of reference sequence &amp; position defined over the reference sequences to which the requested read group sets are aligned.  If a target positional range is specified, search returns all reads whose alignment to the reference genome overlap the range. A query which specifies only read group set IDs yields all reads in those read group sets, including unmapped reads.  All reads returned (including reads on subsequent pages) are ordered by genomic coordinate (by reference sequence, then position). Reads with equivalent genomic coordinates are returned in an unspecified order. This order is consistent, such that two queries for the same content (regardless of page size) yield reads in the same order across their respective streams of paginated responses.  Implements [GlobalAllianceApi.searchReads](https://github.com/ga4gh/schemas/blob/v0.5.1/src/main/resources/avro/readmethods.avdl#L85).

  ## Parameters

  - connection (GoogleApi.Genomics.V1.Connection): Connection to server
  - optional_params (KeywordList): [optional] Optional parameters
    - :$.xgafv (String.t): V1 error format.
    - :access_token (String.t): OAuth access token.
    - :alt (String.t): Data format for response.
    - :callback (String.t): JSONP
    - :fields (String.t): Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.
    - :key (String.t): API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.
    - :oauth_token (String.t): OAuth 2.0 token for the current user.
    - :prettyPrint (boolean()): Returns response with indentations and line breaks.
    - :quotaUser (String.t): Available to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters.
    - :upload_protocol (String.t): Upload protocol for media (e.g. \&quot;raw\&quot;, \&quot;multipart\&quot;).
    - :uploadType (String.t): Legacy upload protocol for media (e.g. \&quot;media\&quot;, \&quot;multipart\&quot;).
    - :body (SearchReadsRequest): 

  ## Returns

  {:ok, %GoogleApi.Genomics.V1.Model.SearchReadsResponse{}} on success
  {:error, info} on failure
