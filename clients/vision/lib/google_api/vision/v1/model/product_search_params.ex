defmodule GoogleApi.Vision.V1.Model.ProductSearchParams do
  @moduledoc """
  Parameters for a product search request.

  ## Attributes

  - boundingPoly (BoundingPoly): The bounding polygon around the area of interest in the image. Optional. If it is not specified, system discretion will be applied. Defaults to: `null`.
  - filter (String.t): The filtering expression. This can be used to restrict search results based on Product labels. We currently support an AND of OR of key-value expressions, where each expression within an OR must have the same key.  For example, \&quot;(color &#x3D; red OR color &#x3D; blue) AND brand &#x3D; Google\&quot; is acceptable, but not \&quot;(color &#x3D; red OR brand &#x3D; Google)\&quot; or \&quot;color: red\&quot;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - productCategories ([String.t]): The list of product categories to search in. Currently, we only consider the first category, and either \&quot;homegoods\&quot;, \&quot;apparel\&quot;, or \&quot;toys\&quot; should be specified. Defaults to: `null`.
  - productSet (String.t): The resource name of a ProductSet to be searched for similar images.  Format is: &#x60;projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOC_ID/productSets/PRODUCT_SET_ID&#x60;. Defaults to: `null`.
