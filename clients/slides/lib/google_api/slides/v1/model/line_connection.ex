defmodule GoogleApi.Slides.V1.Model.LineConnection do
  @moduledoc """
  The properties for one end of a Line connection.

  ## Attributes

  - connectedObjectId (String.t): The object ID of the connected page element.  Some page elements, such as groups, tables, and lines do not have connection sites and therefore cannot be connected to a connector line. Defaults to: `null`.
  - connectionSiteIndex (integer()): The index of the connection site on the connected page element.  In most cases, it corresponds to the predefined connection site index from the ECMA-376 standard. More information on those connection sites can be found in the description of the \&quot;cnx\&quot; attribute in section 20.1.9.9 and Annex H. \&quot;Predefined DrawingML Shape and Text Geometries\&quot; of \&quot;Office Open XML File Formats-Fundamentals and Markup Language Reference\&quot;, part 1 of [ECMA-376 5th edition] (http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-376.htm).  The position of each connection site can also be viewed from Slides editor. Defaults to: `null`.
