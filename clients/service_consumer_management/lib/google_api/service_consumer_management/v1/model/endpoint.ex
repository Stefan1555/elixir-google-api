defmodule GoogleApi.ServiceConsumerManagement.V1.Model.Endpoint do
  @moduledoc """
  &#x60;Endpoint&#x60; describes a network endpoint that serves a set of APIs. A service may expose any number of endpoints, and all endpoints share the same service configuration, such as quota configuration and monitoring configuration.  Example service configuration:      name: library-example.googleapis.com     endpoints:       # Below entry makes &#39;google.example.library.v1.Library&#39;       # API be served from endpoint address library-example.googleapis.com.       # It also allows HTTP OPTIONS calls to be passed to the backend, for       # it to decide whether the subsequent cross-origin request is       # allowed to proceed.     - name: library-example.googleapis.com       allow_cors: true

  ## Attributes

  - aliases ([String.t]): DEPRECATED: This field is no longer supported. Instead of using aliases, please specify multiple google.api.Endpoint for each of the intended aliases.  Additional names that this endpoint will be hosted on. Defaults to: `null`.
  - allowCors (boolean()): Allowing [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing), aka cross-domain traffic, would allow the backends served from this endpoint to receive and respond to HTTP OPTIONS requests. The response will be used by the browser to determine whether the subsequent cross-origin request is allowed to proceed. Defaults to: `null`.
  - features ([String.t]): The list of features enabled on this endpoint. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): The canonical name of this endpoint. Defaults to: `null`.
  - target (String.t): The specification of an Internet routable address of API frontend that will handle requests to this [API Endpoint](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/glossary). It should be either a valid IPv4 address or a fully-qualified domain name. For example, \&quot;8.8.8.8\&quot; or \&quot;myservice.appspot.com\&quot;. Defaults to: `null`.
