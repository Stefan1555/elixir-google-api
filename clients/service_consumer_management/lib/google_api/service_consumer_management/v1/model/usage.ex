defmodule GoogleApi.ServiceConsumerManagement.V1.Model.Usage do
  @moduledoc """
  Configuration controlling usage of a service.

  ## Attributes

  - producerNotificationChannel (String.t): The full resource name of a channel used for sending notifications to the service producer.  Google Service Management currently only supports [Google Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub) as a notification channel. To use Google Cloud Pub/Sub as the channel, this must be the name of a Cloud Pub/Sub topic that uses the Cloud Pub/Sub topic name format documented in https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview. Defaults to: `null`.
  - requirements ([String.t]): Requirements that must be satisfied before a consumer project can use the service. Each requirement is of the form &lt;service.name&gt;/&lt;requirement-id&gt;; for example &#39;serviceusage.googleapis.com/billing-enabled&#39;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - rules ([UsageRule]): A list of usage rules that apply to individual API methods.  **NOTE:** All service configuration rules follow \&quot;last one wins\&quot; order. Defaults to: `null`.
