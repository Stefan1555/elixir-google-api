defmodule GoogleApi.ServiceConsumerManagement.V1.Model.MetricDescriptorMetadata do
  @moduledoc """
  Additional annotations that can be used to guide the usage of a metric.

  ## Attributes

  - ingestDelay (String.t): The delay of data points caused by ingestion. Data points older than this age are guaranteed to be ingested and available to be read, excluding data loss due to errors. Defaults to: `null`.
  - launchStage (String.t): The launch stage of the metric definition. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [LAUNCH_STAGE_UNSPECIFIED, EARLY_ACCESS, ALPHA, BETA, GA, DEPRECATED]
  - samplePeriod (String.t): The sampling period of metric data points. For metrics which are written periodically, consecutive data points are stored at this time interval, excluding data loss due to errors. Metrics with a higher granularity have a smaller sampling period. Defaults to: `null`.
