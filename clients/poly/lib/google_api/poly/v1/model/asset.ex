defmodule GoogleApi.Poly.V1.Model.Asset do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents and describes an asset in the Poly library. An asset is a 3D model or scene created using [Tilt Brush](//www.tiltbrush.com), [Blocks](//vr.google.com/blocks/), or any 3D program that produces a file that can be upload to Poly.

  ## Attributes

  - authorName (String.t): The author&#39;s publicly visible name. Use this name when giving credit to the author. For more information, see [Licensing](/poly/discover/licensing). Defaults to: `null`.
  - createTime (DateTime.t): For published assets, the time when the asset was published. For unpublished assets, the time when the asset was created. Defaults to: `null`.
  - description (String.t): The human-readable description, set by the asset&#39;s author. Defaults to: `null`.
  - displayName (String.t): The human-readable name, set by the asset&#39;s author. Defaults to: `null`.
  - formats ([Format]): A list of Formats where each format describes one representation of the asset. Defaults to: `null`.
  - isCurated (boolean()): Whether this asset has been curated by the Poly team. Defaults to: `null`.
  - license (String.t): The license under which the author has made the asset available for use, if any. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [UNKNOWN, CREATIVE_COMMONS_BY, ALL_RIGHTS_RESERVED]
  - metadata (String.t): Application-defined opaque metadata for this asset. This field is only returned when querying for the signed-in user&#39;s own assets, not for public assets. This string is limited to 1K chars. It is up to the creator of the asset to define the format for this string (for example, JSON). Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): The unique identifier for the asset in the form: &#x60;assets/{ASSET_ID}&#x60;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - presentationParams (PresentationParams): Hints for displaying the asset. Note that these parameters are not immutable; the author of an asset may change them post-publication. Defaults to: `null`.
  - remixInfo (RemixInfo): The remix info for the asset. Defaults to: `null`.
  - thumbnail (File): The thumbnail image for the asset. Defaults to: `null`.
  - updateTime (DateTime.t): The time when the asset was last modified. For published assets, whose contents are immutable, the update time changes only when metadata properties, such as visibility, are updated. Defaults to: `null`.
  - visibility (String.t): The visibility of the asset and who can access it. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [VISIBILITY_UNSPECIFIED, PRIVATE, UNLISTED, PUBLIC]
