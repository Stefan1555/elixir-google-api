defmodule GoogleApi.IAM.V1.Model.ServiceAccount do
  @moduledoc """
  A service account in the Identity and Access Management API.  To create a service account, specify the &#x60;project_id&#x60; and the &#x60;account_id&#x60; for the account.  The &#x60;account_id&#x60; is unique within the project, and is used to generate the service account email address and a stable &#x60;unique_id&#x60;.  If the account already exists, the account&#39;s resource name is returned in the format of projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT}. The caller can use the name in other methods to access the account.  All other methods can identify the service account using the format &#x60;projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT}&#x60;. Using &#x60;-&#x60; as a wildcard for the &#x60;PROJECT_ID&#x60; will infer the project from the account. The &#x60;ACCOUNT&#x60; value can be the &#x60;email&#x60; address or the &#x60;unique_id&#x60; of the service account.

  ## Attributes

  - displayName (String.t): Optional. A user-specified name for the service account. Must be less than or equal to 100 UTF-8 bytes. Defaults to: `null`.
  - email (String.t): @OutputOnly The email address of the service account. Defaults to: `null`.
  - etag (binary()): Optional. Note: &#x60;etag&#x60; is an inoperable legacy field that is only returned for backwards compatibility. Defaults to: `null`.
  - name (String.t): The resource name of the service account in the following format: &#x60;projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT}&#x60;.  Requests using &#x60;-&#x60; as a wildcard for the &#x60;PROJECT_ID&#x60; will infer the project from the &#x60;account&#x60; and the &#x60;ACCOUNT&#x60; value can be the &#x60;email&#x60; address or the &#x60;unique_id&#x60; of the service account.  In responses the resource name will always be in the format &#x60;projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT}&#x60;. Defaults to: `null`.
  - oauth2ClientId (String.t): @OutputOnly The OAuth2 client id for the service account. This is used in conjunction with the OAuth2 clientconfig API to make three legged OAuth2 (3LO) flows to access the data of Google users. Defaults to: `null`.
  - projectId (String.t): @OutputOnly The id of the project that owns the service account. Defaults to: `null`.
  - uniqueId (String.t): @OutputOnly The unique and stable id of the service account. Defaults to: `null`.
