defmodule GoogleApi.IAM.V1.Model.LintPolicyRequest do
  @moduledoc """
  The request to lint a Cloud IAM policy object. LintPolicy is currently functional only for &#x60;lint_object&#x60; of type &#x60;condition&#x60;.

  ## Attributes

  - binding (Binding): Binding object to be linted. The functionality of linting a binding is not yet implemented and if this field is set, it returns NOT_IMPLEMENTED error. Defaults to: `null`.
  - condition (Expr): google.iam.v1.Binding.condition object to be linted. Defaults to: `null`.
  - context (%{optional(String.t) &#x3D;&gt; String.t}): &#x60;context&#x60; contains additional *permission-controlled* data that any lint unit may depend on, in form of &#x60;{key: value}&#x60; pairs. Currently, this field is non-operational and it will not be used during the lint operation. Defaults to: `null`.
  - fullResourceName (String.t): The full resource name of the policy this lint request is about.  The name follows the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resource format. For example, a GCP project with ID &#x60;my-project&#x60; will be named &#x60;//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/my-project&#x60;.  The resource name is not used to read the policy instance from the Cloud IAM database. The candidate policy for lint has to be provided in the same request object. Defaults to: `null`.
  - policy (Policy): Policy object to be linted. The functionality of linting a policy is not yet implemented and if this field is set, it returns NOT_IMPLEMENTED error. Defaults to: `null`.
