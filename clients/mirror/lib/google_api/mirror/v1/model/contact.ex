  - acceptCommands ([Command]): A list of voice menu commands that a contact can handle. Glass shows up to three contacts for each voice menu command. If there are more than that, the three contacts with the highest priority are shown for that particular command. Defaults to: `null`.
  - acceptTypes ([String.t]): A list of MIME types that a contact supports. The contact will be shown to the user if any of its acceptTypes matches any of the types of the attachments on the item. If no acceptTypes are given, the contact will be shown for all items. Defaults to: `null`.
  - displayName (String.t): The name to display for this contact. Defaults to: `null`.
  - id (String.t): An ID for this contact. This is generated by the application and is treated as an opaque token. Defaults to: `null`.
  - imageUrls ([String.t]): Set of image URLs to display for a contact. Most contacts will have a single image, but a \&quot;group\&quot; contact may include up to 8 image URLs and they will be resized and cropped into a mosaic on the client. Defaults to: `null`.
  - kind (String.t): The type of resource. This is always mirror#contact. Defaults to: `null`.
