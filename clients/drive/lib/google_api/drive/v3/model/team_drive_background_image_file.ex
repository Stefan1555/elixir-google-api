defmodule GoogleApi.Drive.V3.Model.TeamDriveBackgroundImageFile do
  @moduledoc """
  An image file and cropping parameters from which a background image for this Team Drive is set. This is a write only field; it can only be set on drive.teamdrives.update requests that don&#39;t set themeId. When specified, all fields of the backgroundImageFile must be set.

  ## Attributes

  - id (String.t): The ID of an image file in Drive to use for the background image. Defaults to: `null`.
  - width (float()): The width of the cropped image in the closed range of 0 to 1. This value represents the width of the cropped image divided by the width of the entire image. The height is computed by applying a width to height aspect ratio of 80 to 9. The resulting image must be at least 1280 pixels wide and 144 pixels high. Defaults to: `null`.
  - xCoordinate (float()): The X coordinate of the upper left corner of the cropping area in the background image. This is a value in the closed range of 0 to 1. This value represents the horizontal distance from the left side of the entire image to the left side of the cropping area divided by the width of the entire image. Defaults to: `null`.
  - yCoordinate (float()): The Y coordinate of the upper left corner of the cropping area in the background image. This is a value in the closed range of 0 to 1. This value represents the vertical distance from the top side of the entire image to the top side of the cropping area divided by the height of the entire image. Defaults to: `null`.
