defmodule GoogleApi.AdExchangeBuyer.V2beta1.Model.PricePerBuyer do
  @moduledoc """
  Used to specify pricing rules for buyers/advertisers. Each PricePerBuyer in a product can become 0 or 1 deals. To check if there is a PricePerBuyer for a particular buyer or buyer/advertiser pair, we look for the most specific matching rule - we first look for a rule matching the buyer and advertiser, next a rule with the buyer but an empty advertiser list, and otherwise look for a matching rule where no buyer is set.

  ## Attributes

  - advertiserIds ([String.t]): The list of advertisers for this price when associated with this buyer. If empty, all advertisers with this buyer pay this price. Defaults to: `null`.
  - buyer (Buyer): The buyer who will pay this price. If unset, all buyers can pay this price (if the advertisers match, and there&#39;s no more specific rule matching the buyer). Defaults to: `null`.
  - price (Price): The specified price. Defaults to: `null`.
